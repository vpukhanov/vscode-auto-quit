# auto-quit

This extension automatically quits Visual Studio Code on macOS after the last window is closed via Command+W shortcut.

## Requirements

All keymaps should be set up automatically on install. If the extension does not work, make sure that

  - Command `autoQuit.keybindings.closeWindow` is bound to `Command+W`
  - Command `autoQuit.keybindings.newWindow` is bound to `Shift+Command+N`
